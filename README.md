# Introduction

Final Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course

## Process:

1) Downloads data file
2) Unzips into working directory
3) completes the required transformation through the 5 steps indicated below


## Instructions from the project description, requirements:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files Included

1) This README.md markdown file
2) CodeBook.md file describing the data, indicating the variable and summaries calculated
3) run_analysis.R R file, saved with all the codes to do transformation above
4) tidy.txt file with tidy data as required
